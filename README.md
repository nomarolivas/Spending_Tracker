# Spending_Tracker
Spending Tracker 
By Nomar Olivas

Proposal: 
Create an iOS application that can keep track on all of a user’s spendings by logging the spendings based on 4 categories: Restaurant and Dining, Groceries, Shopping and Entertainment, and Cash, Checks, other. 

Must Have Features:
- Ability to display overall total on starting screen
- Display each category using a tableview
- Display each category’s total on each screen
- Allow user to input amount by entering amount based on the category they spent the money on
- Ability to store all amounts, including when application is done running
- Erase all data with a click of a button

Nice to have features: 
- Display a list of logs that shows the category and amount the user spent on a separate screen
- Change the tableview based on which category the user spent the most on
- Display the dates of when a user adds a new amount
- Pictures for each category 
- Dark mode
